        <p>Our project was inspired by research in depth perception and spatial orientation in VR. It is a simple puzzle-based cube world, and opens with the user standing in small maze. The goal of this first level is to find an object and return it to a target location. Projected onto the walls is an overhead view of the maze, with which the user is meant to navigate. There are also local map projections on a cube and sphere, which are meant to augment and challenge the user’s sense of spatial orientation, respectively. This level is meant to be performed standing, and users are asked to report their orientation in the real word by pointing at the end of the maze. </p>
        <p>In our second scene, we set out to challenge the player’s sense of depth perception in the virtual world. It should be noted that this reverse gravity level should be avoided by users with a fear of falling. The goal here is to retrieve one of the rogue cubes, and return it to the bucket on the other side of the room. We encourage the curious to try this level both in and out of VR, as most subjects reported significantly higher difficulty in the task without the stereoscopic view.</p>
